# Data Challenge: Predicting reason of employee absence

## Overview
This data challenge focuses on predicting the reason of absence of employees at a brazilian courier company based on various personal, work-related, and health-related factors. The motivation of this challenge is to permit companies and public administrations to help detect or asses potential fraud by comparing the reason of absence at work declared by employees and the reason predicted by a machine learning model.

## Dataset Description
The database was created with records of absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil.
It contains 21 input features and 1 categorical target variable that is `Reason_for_absence`. Each line represents an absence instance with multiple attributes related to personal demographics, work conditions, and health status.

9. **Age** (`Age`): Employeeâ€™s age in years.
10. **Work load Average/day** (`Work_load_Average/day_`): Average workload per day.
11. **Hit target** (`Hit_target`): Performance target hit percentage.
12. **Disciplinary failure** (`Disciplinary_failure`): 1 if the employee has disciplinary failures, otherwise 0.

19. **Height** (`Height`): Employeeâ€™s height.
20. **Body mass index** (`Body_mass_index`): Calculated BMI.
21. **Absenteeism time in hours** (`Absenteeism_time_in_hours`): total absence hours.


## Evaluation Metric
Given the difficulty to predict the exact reason of absence among a lot of possibilities, the evaluation metric will be the top 4 F1 score.
